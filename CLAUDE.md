# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Docker-based vectorization RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project. It represents a learning project focused on:
- Docker containerization
- Vector-based retrieval systems
- RAG agents using Claude

## Repository Status

This repository is currently in its initial state with only basic configuration files:
- MIT License
- Basic README describing the project intent

## Development Setup

The project appears to be in early development phase with no build system, dependencies, or source code yet implemented. Future development will likely involve:
- Docker configuration files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- Python or JavaScript/TypeScript codebase for RAG implementation
- Vector database integration
- Claude API integration

## Architecture Notes

As this is an early-stage project focused on learning Docker and RAG systems, the architecture will evolve as implementation progresses. Key components will likely include:
- Containerized services for different RAG components
- Vector storage and retrieval systems
- Claude integration for language model capabilities

## Development Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently available as the project is in its initial setup phase.
